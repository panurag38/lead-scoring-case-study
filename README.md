# lead-scoring-case-study
Welcome to Lead Scoring Case Study! ðŸš€

**Goals of the Case Study**
1. Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.
2. There are some more problems presented by the company which our model should be able to adjust to if the company's requirement changes in the future so we have handled them as well. These problem's solutions are provided in a separate doc file.

**Business Objective: **
Lead X has tasked us with developing a model to assign a lead score ranging from 0 to 100 to each potential lead. The primary objective is to identify "Hot Leads" effectively, thereby elevating the overall lead conversion rate. The CEO is aiming for an ambitious lead conversion rate of 80%. Additionally, the model is expected to proactively address future challenges, including optimizing actions during peak times, maximizing workforce utilization, and providing strategic guidance once the 80% conversion
